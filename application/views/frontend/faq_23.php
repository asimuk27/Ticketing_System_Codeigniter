                            	<p>TicketingSystem provides many options to assist you to do better at fundraising for your cause.  Feel free to talk to our experienced team to discuss how you can maximise opportunities.</p>
								<p>What is a Champion?</p>
								<p>A Champion is the person who will fundraise for the event/cause. They can set up a profile page and will send this link on to their network via social media or email to fundraise. All Champions can be approved by the Event Manager before their profile is published. All funds raised by your champions are directly deposited into the assigned account chosen by the organisation. Typically this is the account of the Charity.</p>
								<p>What is a Supporter?</p>
								<p>The Supporter is an individual or organisation that gives funds to the champion towards the event. The Supporter has a selection of online payment gateways to choose from. To save on costs Poli is the preferred method of payment for most charities.</p>
								<p>What is a sponsor?</p>
								<p>A sponsor is any person or organisation that wants to sponsor the charity. There is a link for them to connect with the Event Manager to discuss what level of sponsorship they wish to contribute. The sponsorship contract is between the Event Organisation and the Sponsors Organisation directly. </p>
